<p><strong>Our Industry</strong></p><p>There are 20 million single family residences (SFRs) in the United States, more than 19 million of which are owned by 15.5 million “very small investors,” individuals or families who own one or two units. For these rental property owners, there is little in the way of data or technology to help them understand the market rental rates for their property, find and market to the highest quality prospective tenants, and manage the ongoing maintenance of their rental units with minimal headache. Pain points like these are why more than a third of all SFR owners turn to property managers for help.</p><p><br/></p><p>Full-service property management for SFRs is a hyper-local and highly fragmented business. And just like the owners, property managers have little in the way of data, tools, and automated processes to enable them to scale and work smartly. Further, there is a misalignment of incentives between traditional property managers and the owners they represent – managers can promise a high rental rate to win the business, but do so without consequence if they secure a lower rate. They pitch fast leasing timeframes but have no skin in the game when vacancies stretch from weeks to months. Missteps on both of these fronts come at a high cost; they often are the difference between a homeowner making or losing money on their rental property each year.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Our Company</strong></p><p>Doorstead is here to address these pain points and more which have long been considered “unfixable” by property owners. Doorstead is a full-service, technology-operations driven property manager that supports the two-sided marketplace of owners and tenants. For owners, we eliminate uncertainty by leveraging an upfront pricing model to set list price based on real-time, localized supply and demand. We invested early in building local data sets and machine learning models, leveraging hundreds of variables for a given home to predict market-clearing rents that minimize vacancy,maximize owner cash flow, and align incentives of the owner and property manager.</p><p><br/></p><p>In 5 years of operations, we’ve booked $60M+ gross rents, indexed rental prices for over 10MM properties, and raised ~$38M from the investors who backed Redfin with participation from executives at Opendoor and Uber. Without that winning team, we would not be where we are today.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><p>We are looking for a <strong>Finance Manager</strong> to be the core member of our finance team. This individual is an experienced finance partner to the business but also a <strong>data-driven problem solver</strong>. This is not a traditional accounting role—the ideal candidate will be comfortable <strong>working with large and complex data sets, querying databases, reconciling transactions at scale, and overseeing financial operations with a technology-operations mindset</strong>. This individual will also drive our monthly payments cycle, execution of cross-functional strategic initiatives to improve our payment operations, and partner directly with executives on building scalable processes. This role will directly manage the day-to-day function of our finance &amp; payments systems with a dedicated team of 4.</p><p><br/></p><p>This is a remote position, allowing employees to work from any location within the US with limited exceptions. The base pay range is $90,000-100,000, with the addition of equity awards.

<!-- --> </div>","Our IndustryThere are 20 million single family residences (SFRs) in the United States, more than 19 million of which are owned by 15.5 million “very small investors,” individuals or families who own one or two units. For these rental property owners, there is little in the way of data or technology to help them understand the market rental rates for their property, find and market to the highest quality prospective tenants, and manage the ongoing maintenance of their rental units with minimal headache. Pain points like these are why more than a third of all SFR owners turn to property managers for help.Full-service property management for SFRs is a hyper-local and highly fragmented business. And just like the owners, property managers have little in the way of data, tools, and automated processes to enable them to scale and work smartly. Further, there is a misalignment of incentives between traditional property managers and the owners they represent – managers can promise a high rental rate to win the business, but do so without consequence if they secure a lower rate. They pitch fast leasing timeframes but have no skin in the game when vacancies stretch from weeks to months. Missteps on both of these fronts come at a high cost; they often are the difference between a homeowner making or losing money on their rental property each year.Our CompanyDoorstead is here to address these pain points and more which have long been considered “unfixable” by property owners. Doorstead is a full-service, technology-operations driven property manager that supports the two-sided marketplace of owners and tenants. For owners, we eliminate uncertainty by leveraging an upfront pricing model to set list price based on real-time, localized supply and demand. We invested early in building local data sets and machine learning models, leveraging hundreds of variables for a given home to predict market-clearing rents that minimize vacancy,maximize owner cash flow, and align incentives of the owner and property manager.In 5 years of operations, we’ve booked $60M+ gross rents, indexed rental prices for over 10MM properties, and raised ~$38M from the investors who backed Redfin with participation from executives at Opendoor and Uber. Without that winning team, we would not be where we are today.The RoleWe are looking for a Finance Manager to be the core member of our finance team. This individual is an experienced finance partner to the business but also a data-driven problem solver. This is not a traditional accounting role—the ideal candidate will be comfortable working with large and complex data sets, querying databases, reconciling transactions at scale, and overseeing financial operations with a technology-operations mindset. This individual will also drive our monthly payments cycle, execution of cross-functional strategic initiatives to improve our payment operations, and partner directly with executives on building scalable processes. This role will directly manage the day-to-day function of our finance & payments systems with a dedicated team of 4.This is a remote position, allowing employees to work from any location within the US with limited exceptions. The base pay range is $90,000-100,000, with the addition of equity awards. Pay and equity may differ based on experience, performance, and location.ResponsibilitiesFinancial Operations & ReportingOwn the monthly, quarterly, and annual financial close process, ensuring accuracy and timeliness in financial reporting.Oversee the general ledger, financial statements, and internal controls, ensuring compliance with GAAP and regulatory requirements.Develop and maintain scalable accounting policies and procedures to support business growth.Data-Driven Financial ManagementAnalyze and reconcile large and complex data sets, particularly in payments, revenue recognition, and property transactions.Query databases (SQL) to extract and validate financial data for reporting and analysis.Design and implement automated financial reconciliation processes for high-volume transactions across multiple systems.Collaborate with engineering to enhance financial data integrity, resolve discrepancies, and improve reporting accuracy.Payments & Cash Flow ManagementOversee the payments and billing systems, ensuring accuracy in property owner payouts, rent collections, and expense allocations.Work closely with product and engineering teams to enhance automation and scalability in financial operations.Manage cash flow forecasting and working capital optimization, ensuring sufficient liquidity for business operations.Audit, Compliance & ControlsEnsure SOX compliance, internal controls, and financial risk management best practices.Lead internal and external audit processes, liaising with auditors, tax advisors, and regulatory bodies.Stay updated on accounting and tax regulations applicable to real estate, proptech, and fintech sectors.Strategic Financial Insights & LeadershipPartner with leadership to drive financial planning, budgeting, and performance analysis.Provide data-driven insights and recommendations to improve profitability, cost efficiency, and operational effectiveness.Support M&A due diligence, investor reporting, and strategic decision-making as needed.Requirements3+ years of experience in accounting or financial operations in a tech-ops business or fintechProficiency in SQL & Python is requiredStrong background in financial reporting, GAAP, and accounting principlesExperience with large-scale reconciliations & payment processingStrong understanding of Quickbooks and financial automation toolsProven track record of delivering large-scale and cross-functional business process initiativesBenefitsMedical health insurance - 100% covered for primary and 50% for dependents.Vision and dental insurance - 50% covered for primary.401KBasic life and disability insuranceHealth Care FSA - primary and dependentNew parent leave - for new family formationUnlimited PTO and Company Holidays - office closure during national holidays, and flexible time-off with manager approval",4177999441,finance
