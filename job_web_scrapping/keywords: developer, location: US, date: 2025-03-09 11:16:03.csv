<strong>About Us<br/><br/></strong>We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.<br/><br/>We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.<br/><br/>Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).<br/><br/><strong>About The Role<br/><br/></strong>As a Core Product engineer, you will directly contribute to the foundational pieces of Notion's building blocks. You will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that allows Notion to achieve the connected workspace vision. Your work will include both internal platform contributions to accelerate other Notion engineering teams, and end-user facing functionality to enable toolmaking ubiquity. The team acts as a multiplier for the engineering organization, has outsize impact on how fast Notion grows, and guides the full-stack direction. Moreover, you will be presented with challenging technical problems as Notion’s product needs are complex. You’ll also play a key role in identifying and executing against technical investments that ensure the long-term quality, reliability, and performance of databases in Notion as we scale. You will help define team norms, operating principles, team culture, and much more.<br/><br/><strong>What You'll Achieve<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to define a product strategy and drive execution through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance.</li><li>You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more.</li><li>You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions.</li><li>You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems.<br/><br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Skills You'll Need To Bring<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Proven track record of execution: You have 2+ years of fullstack engineering experience, including building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers.</li><li>Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and deign to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.</li><li>Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.</li><li>Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives.

<strong>Warning</strong>: if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.<br/><br/>Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.<br/><br/>Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.<br/><br/>We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.<br/><br/>We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.<br/><br/><strong>What You’ll Do<br/><br/></strong>As an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to:<br/><br/><ul><li>Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.)</li><li>Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it!</li><li>Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web.</li><li>Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested.</li><li>Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows.</li><li>Review code written by other engineers.</li><li>Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.<br/><br/></li></ul>This position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.<br/><br/><strong>What You Might Work On<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier.</li><li>AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention.</li><li>Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones.</li><li>A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels.</li><li>Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them.</li><li>A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native.</li><li>Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them.</li><li>Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too.</li><li>Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats.</li><li>Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.<br/><br/></li></ul>What’s it like to work here?<br/><br/>We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.<br/><br/>Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.<br/><br/>We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.<br/><br/>Our hiring process<br/><br/>We’ll first have you do an asynchronous programming challenge. If all goes well, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language. We’ll then do another coding interview and a full-day virtual onsite.<br/><br/>Founders<br/><br/>Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.<br/><br/>Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.<br/><br/>Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!

<strong>Warning</strong>: if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.<br/><br/>Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.<br/><br/>Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.<br/><br/>We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 8, including 7 engineers hailing from MIT, the University of Toronto, UC Berkeley, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.<br/><br/>We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.<br/><br/><strong>What You’ll Do<br/><br/></strong>As an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to:<br/><br/><ul><li>Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.)</li><li>Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it!</li><li>Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web.</li><li>Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested.</li><li>Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows.</li><li>Review code written by other engineers.</li><li>Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.<br/><br/></li></ul>This position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.<br/><br/><strong>What You Might Work On<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier.</li><li>AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention.</li><li>Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones.</li><li>A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels.</li><li>Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them.</li><li>A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.<br/><br/></li></ul><strong>You May Be a Good Fit If You<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native.</li><li>Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them.</li><li>Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too.</li><li>Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats.</li><li>Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.<br/><br/></li></ul>What’s it like to work here?<br/><br/>We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.<br/><br/>Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.<br/><br/>We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.<br/><br/>Our hiring process<br/><br/>We’ll first have you do an asynchronous programming challenge. If all goes well, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language. We’ll then do another coding interview and a full-day virtual onsite.<br/><br/>Founders<br/><br/>Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.<br/><br/>Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.<br/><br/>Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!

We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.<br/><br/>Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).<br/><br/><strong>About The Role<br/><br/></strong>Notion's Growth Engineers make our mission of software ubiquity a reality.

<p><strong>About Lumafield: </strong></p><p></p><p>Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing. </p><p></p><p>We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it. </p><p></p><p>Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively. </p><p></p><p> We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again. </p><p></p><p>Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>About the role: </strong></p><p></p><p>Lumafield is bringing volumetric visualization, inspection and analysis tools to the web. Our growing web app is the primary channel through which customers access, view, and interact with their data and is an exciting alternative to the traditionally clunky, expensive, OS-specific software applications used in the past. </p><p></p><p>As a Frontend Engineer, you will work with designers and other developers to build thoughtful and functional interfaces to inspect, interact and analyze large volumetric data sets.  You will have ownership over projects as you help us develop new features and get them into the hands of customers quickly.  We are excited about building new tools in our React-based applications and frequently interface with a backend stack of Django, Postgres, AWS and other technologies to support fast data processing and access. We don’t expect you to be an expert in all of these technologies, but an eagerness to engage with them is a huge plus.</p><p></p><p>If you are interested in joining a well-funded growth stage company this is the perfect opportunity for you to become a part of the Lumafield team. </p><p><p><br/></p><strong>What you'll do: </strong><ul><li>Build and iterate on intuitive user interfaces for interacting with 3D data</li><li>Write production-ready, well-tested code utilizing React, Redux, Typescript, Three.js, and WebGL</li><li>Collaborate with other frontend engineers via code reviews and technical discussions</li><li>Work cross functionally with a team of designers, engineers across a range of disciplines, and scientists</li><li>Communicate and document technical and architectural decisions</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>About you: </strong><ul><li>Have designed and implemented software throughout its lifecycle, taking a product from napkin sketches through shipping and maintenance</li><li>Have worked with a team to build software</li><li>Are customer obsessed and passionate about building high performance, user-friendly web apps</li><li>Can rapidly develop UI elements and new features in collaboration with designers and engineers</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>Bonus points: </strong><ul><li>Previous experience with digital or other manufacturing and design technologies</li><li>A portfolio of previous work that you can share</li></ul></p><p><br/></p><br/><p>Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health &amp; wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more! </p><p></p><p>Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Do you feel like your skills don’t meet every single requirement listed? We encourage you to apply anyway – If you’re excited about our technology, the opportunity, and are eager to learn more we’d love to hear from you!  </p><p></p><p>In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information or veteran status. </p><p></p><p>Reach out if you want to be a part of what we are building.</p><br/><br/>The salary range listed here represents the anticipated low and high end of the salary range for this position and includes base salary plus variable commissions. Actual salaries may vary and may be above or below the range based on various factors including but not limited to work location, experience, and performance. All full time employees receive an equity grant.

<p><strong>About Lumafield: </strong></p><p></p><p>Lumafield was founded in 2019 to upgrade manufacturing. </p><p></p><p>We are engineers with deep experience across the product development cycle, from initial ideas to shipping hardware, across industries and specializations, who became frustrated by the cost and complexity of modern manufacturing. So we decided to upgrade it. </p><p></p><p>Engineers make million-dollar decisions every day, and they need tools that give them the greatest possible insight into their products. By offering unprecedented visibility into products, as well as AI-driven tools that highlight problems and generate quantitative data, Lumafield promises to revolutionize the way complex products are created, manufactured, and used across industries. We started with industrial CT scanning, which for us was the most valuable but underutilized tool in the manufacturing toolbox, enabling us to rapidly inspect essential components non-destructively. </p><p></p><p> We rebuilt the whole system, from X-ray capture, to computer vision analysis, to web-based collaboration, to the entire business model, making the most advanced manufacturing tech more accessible to every industry. Our company, like our platform, is designed for upgrades. We’re building for greater intelligence, autonomy, and speed. For deeper vision, operational excellence, and powerful insights. And then we'll upgrade it all again. </p><p></p><p>Lumafield is headquartered in Cambridge, MA, and has an office in San Francisco, CA. </p><p><br/></p><p><strong>About the role: </strong></p><p></p><p>Lumafield is bringing volumetric visualization, inspection and analysis tools to the web. Our growing web app is the primary channel through which customers access, view, and interact with their data and is an exciting alternative to the traditionally clunky, expensive, OS-specific software applications used in the past. </p><p></p><p>As a Frontend Engineer, you will work with designers and other developers to build thoughtful and functional interfaces to inspect, interact and analyze large volumetric data sets.  You will have ownership over projects as you help us develop new features and get them into the hands of customers quickly.  We are excited about building new tools in our React-based applications and frequently interface with a backend stack of Django, Postgres, AWS and other technologies to support fast data processing and access. We don’t expect you to be an expert in all of these technologies, but an eagerness to engage with them is a huge plus.</p><p></p><p>If you are interested in joining a well-funded growth stage company this is the perfect opportunity for you to become a part of the Lumafield team. </p><p><p><br/></p><strong>What you'll do: </strong><ul><li>Build and iterate on intuitive user interfaces for interacting with 3D data</li><li>Write production-ready, well-tested code utilizing React, Redux, Typescript, Three.js, and WebGL</li><li>Collaborate with other frontend engineers via code reviews and technical discussions</li><li>Work cross functionally with a team of designers, engineers across a range of disciplines, and scientists</li><li>Communicate and document technical and architectural decisions</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>About you: </strong><ul><li>Have designed and implemented software throughout its lifecycle, taking a product from napkin sketches through shipping and maintenance</li><li>Have worked with a team to build software</li><li>Are customer obsessed and passionate about building high performance, user-friendly web apps</li><li>Can rapidly develop UI elements and new features in collaboration with designers and engineers</li></ul><p><br/></p><strong>Bonus points: </strong><ul><li>Previous experience with digital or other manufacturing and design technologies</li><li>A portfolio of previous work that you can share</li></ul></p><p><br/></p><br/><p>Lumafield offers both competitive cash and equity compensation, as well as a health &amp; wellness stipend, 401k, parental leave, flexible PTO, commuter benefits, company wide events and more! </p><p></p><p>Lumafield is committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills, because the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Do you feel like your skills don’t meet every single requirement listed? We encourage you to apply anyway – If you’re excited about our technology, the opportunity, and are eager to learn more we’d love to hear from you!  </p><p></p><p>In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information or veteran status. </p><p></p><p>Reach out if you want to be a part of what we are building.</p><br/><br/>The salary range listed here represents the anticipated low and high end of the salary range for this position and includes base salary plus variable commissions.

<strong>About Us<br/><br/></strong>We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.<br/><br/>We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.<br/><br/>Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).<br/><br/><strong>About The Role<br/><br/></strong>Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to keep their data secure and private, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion.<br/><br/>As a member of the Trust Engineering team, you'll have many opportunities to safeguard Notion's community and help build a trustworthy environment. You'll partner with product and infrastructure teams to integrate trust and safety into Notion's technology stack, promoting sustainable growth towards becoming a universally used product. Additionally, you'll collaborate with our Trust &amp; Safety operations team to anticipate changing attack vectors and foster a positive user experience.<br/><br/><strong>What You'll Achieve<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Built product features, platforms, and machine learning / AI models to protect Notion’s community from account takeovers, phishing, objectionable content, spam and other kinds of fraud and abuse</li><li>Partner closely with Trust and Safety ops and other security teams to investigate new attack vectors, manage incidents, and improve internal tooling and automation</li><li>Contribute to the vision and roadmaps for this team and articulate Notion’s overall approach and philosophy on Trust Engineering<br/><br/><br/></li></ul><strong>What We’re Looking For<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You have 5+ years of engineering experience and can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates.</li><li>Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.</li><li>Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.</li><li>Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.</li><li>Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.<br/><br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Nice To Haves<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Trust expertise: You bring multiple years of software engineering experience in the areas of trust, safety, and user authentication.</li><li>Cross-functional collaboration: You have a history of strong cross-functional collaboration with trust and safety ops, legal, and/or other non-technical teams.</li><li>Technology stack: You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</li><li>Startup mentality: You are comfortable navigating the fast moving, unstructured nature of a hyper-growth startup. You are self-motivated to add value and bias towards action.<br/><br/><br/></li></ul>We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.<br/><br/>Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.<br/><br/>Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.

For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $160,000 - $250,000 per year.<br/><br/>

<strong>About Us<br/><br/></strong>We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.<br/><br/>We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.<br/><br/>Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).<br/><br/><strong>About The Role<br/><br/></strong>Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to keep their data secure and private, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion.<br/><br/>As a member of the Trust Engineering team, you'll have many opportunities to safeguard Notion's community and help build a trustworthy environment. You'll partner with product and infrastructure teams to integrate trust and safety into Notion's technology stack, promoting sustainable growth towards becoming a universally used product. Additionally, you'll collaborate with our Trust &amp; Safety operations team to anticipate changing attack vectors and foster a positive user experience.<br/><br/><strong>What You'll Achieve<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Built product features, platforms, and machine learning / AI models to protect Notion’s community from account takeovers, phishing, objectionable content, spam and other kinds of fraud and abuse</li><li>Partner closely with Trust and Safety ops and other security teams to investigate new attack vectors, manage incidents, and improve internal tooling and automation</li><li>Contribute to the vision and roadmaps for this team and articulate Notion’s overall approach and philosophy on Trust Engineering<br/><br/><br/></li></ul><strong>What We’re Looking For<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You have 5+ years of engineering experience and can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates.</li><li>Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.</li><li>Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.</li><li>Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.</li><li>Team player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.<br/><br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Nice To Haves<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Trust expertise: You bring multiple years of software engineering experience in the areas of trust, safety, and user authentication.</li><li>Cross-functional collaboration: You have a history of strong cross-functional collaboration with trust and safety ops, legal, and/or other non-technical teams.</li><li>Technology stack: You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.</li><li>Startup mentality: You are comfortable navigating the fast moving, unstructured nature of a hyper-growth startup. You are self-motivated to add value and bias towards action.<br/><br/><br/></li></ul>We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.<br/><br/>Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.<br/><br/>Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $160,000 - $250,000 per year.<br/><br/>

We also offer competitive compensation, benefits, and profession development opportunities. Please refer to our Benefits section for additional details.<br/><br/><strong>Flex Time<br/><br/></strong>Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John's IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.<br/><br/><strong>Individual Benefits Account (IBA)<br/><br/></strong>To attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset - the employee.<br/><br/>The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:<br/><br/><ul><li>Medical and Vision Insurance through United Health Care; Dental insurance through Delta Dental</li><li>100% Medical Reimbursement</li><li>Time Off with Pay</li><li>Profit Sharing Plan</li><li>401k</li><li>Educational Benefits</li><li>Additional Income<br/><br/></li></ul>IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee's monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee's salary.<br/><br/><strong>Profit Sharing Plan (PSP)<br/><br/></strong>The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds quarterly on the employee's behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee's compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.<br/><br/><strong>Stock Options<br/><br/></strong>Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.<br/><br/><strong>Lifelong Learning<br/><br/></strong>Our culture promotes and nurtures a growth environment.

<strong>About Us<br/><br/></strong>We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day.

<strong>The Role <br/><br/></strong>We're seeking out a Santa Barbara based Software Engineer to develop platform capabilities across our full stack - from user-facing workflows to high-throughput payment, notification, and data sync systems. As one of the largest financial solutions providers in our industry, everything we build operates at scale from day one, and you will be shipping capabilities that impact millions of users. In addition to application code, you’ll also be working on the development infrastructure that allows our organization to scale safely - including automated testing, monitoring, and internal tooling. The common denominator across every project you work on will be a deep sense of craft - both as an individual and as a collective team - that drives product excellence and ultimately enables us to be the winners in our space.<br/><br/><strong>Our Stack<br/><br/></strong>Pearly operates on a hyper-modern stack that is optimized for developer experience and scalability. You’ll be releasing code that is high-impact, simple, and safe from day one - working predominantly in Typescript, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. Our tooling leverages the best of open source and cloud-based capabilities - including Serverless Functions, GitHub Actions, Docker, and Playwright. We put a lot of thought into how to make shipping code at Pearly as fun and low-friction as possible, and we’re constantly iterating on our stack/tooling to stay at the leading edge (we’re currently loving Cursor and Granola).<br/><br/><strong>What You'll Do<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Own the full development cycle: You'll be involved in every step of development, from product ideation, to specification, through to implementation and release to Production. </li><li>Define the platform: You will research and make judgement calls on fundamental decisions regarding data modeling, architecture, infrastructure, and tooling. </li><li>Collaborate effectively: We operate as a flat, mutually supportive, highly connected team where frequent input and collaboration is expected and best ideas always win. </li><li>Build the path forward: You'll be entrusted to build today what we need for tomorrow - we believe in creating generalized frameworks that anticipate future needs as a core development principle. <br/><br/></li></ul><strong>Qualifications<br/><br/></strong><ul><li>Sense of Craft. You take pride in and are consistently honing your technical and creative abilities. You seek out opportunities to introduce simplicity and elegance, and enjoy composing solutions to business requirements in a way that is both innovative and effective. </li><li>1+ Years Deploying to Prod: You have an understanding of the requirements and stakes involved in deploying live systems.

The ability to learn quickly and deeply is more important than any particular technology, although a strong understanding of relational data modeling is a must. </li><li>Willing to Roll Up Your Sleeves. Taking the initiative is second nature to you. You will operate with a high degree of autonomy, take projects to the finish line, and own the outcome. </li><li>Based in Santa Barbara, CA.
